## Hosted Project

We named our project Fittrack and hosted it on UTA Cloud. You can access the hosted project [here](https://knv2382.uta.cloud/).

### Running with Docker:

1. Build the Docker Image:
   ```bash
   docker compose build --no-cache
   ```
2. Run the Docker Container:
   ```bash
   docker compose up
   ```
   The project will now be accessible at:
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3000
   - Backend: http://localhost:5000

### Login Details

The login page allows users to sign in either as Admin or User.

- **Admin Panel:**
  - Username: admin@mavs.uta.edu
  - Password: admin@123
- **User Panel:**
  - Username: user@mavs.uta.edu
  - Password: user@123

## Features Implemented

This phase primarily focused on **backend feature expansion** along with integration into the frontend pages. Major enhancements included:

- **JWT Authentication & Secure Routing:**

  - Token-based login/signup for both users and admins.
  - Middleware (`verifyToken.js`) added to protect sensitive routes.

- **Activity Logging:**

  - Log workouts and exercises.
  - Track completion status.
  - View complete history of user activities.

- **Goal Management:**

  - Create, update, delete goals.
  - Fetch progress metrics.
  - Integrated analytics with charts.

- **AI-Powered Nutrition System:**

  - Gemini 2.0 Flash-Lite model integrated via backend.
  - Personalized meal recommendations.
  - Responses cached to reduce repeated API calls.

- **Analytics Dashboard:**

  - Backend APIs serve goal, nutrition, and activity data.
  - Frontend uses Recharts to visualize analytics.

- **Admin Control Panel Enhancements:**
  - Add/edit exercises and workouts.
  - Manage Gemini prompt templates for nutrition AI.
